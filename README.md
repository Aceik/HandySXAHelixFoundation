Use best practice page load techniques to achieve Outstanding Page Speed scores in SXA. 

## What does it do ?

Speedy provides a Sitecore Layout and Asset provider that structures your HTML in accordance with Google's recommendations.  Google ranks your website with a score out of 100 and provides recommendation on how to achieve better scores.
Implementing Critical CSS and Deferred Javascript loading can be tricky. This module provides a framework and the tools needed to automate the process. 

## What structure is this module written in ?

This is a Sitecore Helix module. 

It is planned to release this module as an installable Sitecore package as well.

## What does Speedy solve in regard to Page Speed ?

In order to get great page speed scores there are several aspects you need to address. [Read more here.](https://github.com/Aceik/Sitecore-Speedy/wiki/Page-Speed-Considerations)

This module addresses Critical CSS and Deferred asset loading, which is perhaps one of the hardest parts of Page Speed to get right.

## Installation prerequisites

Pre-Requisuits 
1) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/requires-node-blue.svg?style=flat-square" alt="requires node">  (Required in [local development mode](https://github.com/Aceik/Sitecore-Speedy/wiki/Development-Mode))
2) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/requires-sitecore-blue.svg?style=flat-square" alt="requires node">

## Installation

### From Helix Source (Assumes Unicorn already installed)
	- Incorporate the module into your Foundation layer and VS solution
	- Publish project to your running IIS site or deploy via CI/CD
	- Run a unicorn sync for the module Foundation.Speedy
		a) Templates will be installed here: /sitecore/templates/Foundation/Speedy/
		b) A global settings file is installed here:  /sitecore/system/Settings/Foundation/Speedy/Speedy Global Settings
		c) A new SXA Layout will be installed here: /sitecore/layout/Layouts/Foundation/Speedy/MVC/MVC Layout Page Speed

### Sitecore Package
	- Download and install the Sitecore Package that corresponds to your SXA/Sitecore version in releases.

## SXA Templates

Update your the desired SXA template to include the new base _SpeedyPage base template.
   
You may choose to add Speedy techniques to only the homepage in which case you could:
	- Locate the Home tempalte that was generated by SXA, it should be located in 
	> /sitecore/templates/Project/Site/Home 
	and make it inherit from:  
	> /sitecore/templates/Foundation/Speedy/_SpeedyPage
	- To make all pages in your SXA site use Speedy you need to locate the Page template (within you SXA generated site templates) 
	> /sitecore/templates/Project/Site/Page 
	and make it inherit from _SpeedyPage. 

## Usage on a Page

Which ever page you now choose to use Speedy on, navigate to that item:
	
	- Make a new version of the item, so that you can roll back if needed.
	- Presentation > Details > Final Layout :  Change the layout to 
	> Layouts/Foundation/Speedy/MVC/MVC Layout Page Speed
	- Save and publish the item

## Critical Generation 

In order to grab the critical CSS for the viewport we use an NPM tool.  https://www.npmjs.com/package/critical

Included in this repository are two scripts, one that can be hosted and one that can be run on a local development environment by developers. 

### Critical Generation

Two modes are available to run the NPM Critical tool depending what sort of environment your running.
1) [Production Mode](https://github.com/Aceik/Sitecore-Speedy/wiki/Production-Mode) -- For public facing websites that are accessable via a public domain. This mode reads from a remote API to generate the Critical CSS. 
2) [Development Mode](https://github.com/Aceik/Sitecore-Speedy/wiki/Development-Mode) -- For development machines that have a development URL like localhost. This mode uses your local Node install to generate the Critical CSS.

Use one of the above modes to ensure that Critical CSS is stored against your page in Sitecore.

## Time to Adapt  - Tweak and Test

After following the above instructions its time to run the Lighthouse Audit in your browser and check your page speed score. 

Different pages will have different features, javascript and appearance. The end result that you get using these techniques can be different on every page.

At the end of the day what your trying to achieve is something like this:

- Display the HTML and CSS of the viewport so that First Contentful Paint happens as soon as possible.  Hide DOM object that require javascript to be full loaded. 

- After a certain period start loading external resources. 

- After loading resources begin to show DOM object that require all the javascript to be loaded and parsed by the browser. These resources are original hidden using Vanilla JS and are now made visible. (Fallback Experience)

##### NOTE:  Javascript by far has the most impact on this whole process as it is the most expensive asset a users browser will download, parse (code parse) and ultimately run. 

This module has some options available for tweaking and retesting. 

| Name          						| Field Name           	| Description  |
| ------------- 						|:-------------:		| -----:|
| Defer JS Load For Milliseconds      	| The length of time to delay the load of external Javscript assets for (in milliseconds) 		| $1600 |
| Defer CSS Load For Milliseconds      	| The length of time to delay the load of external CSS assets for (in milliseconds)      		|   $12 |
| Defer Fallback Load For Milliseconds 	| The length of time to delay the visibility of certain DOM elements (in milliseconds). Based on the next setting. 				|		|
| CSS Fallback Experience Selector 		| This css selector is done on a per page basis and allows the hiding and showing of DOM elements in order to support a Fallback Experience.     				|		|

-----------------------

## Complex Issues

In reality there is nothing simple about getting Critical and Javascript to play together. 

This process will take some trial and error, the aim of which is to present the user with an experience that is so quick that they don't notice and strange behaviour at all.

Strange behaviour usually includes flashing or mutating elements (in the blink of eye) as the deferred page load assets are loaded into the DOM.  This is due to the fact that these assets are delayed and once they are loaded they each impact the DOM in turn.
